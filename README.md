  Dollar-Cost Averaging Strategy with lemon.markets API üçã 
</h1>

This is a public [lemon.markets](https://lemon.markets) repository that outlines a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy using our API. To get a general understanding of the API, please refer to our [documentation](https://docs.lemon.markets). 

## Instructions for Use

This script can be used as a starting point to implement your own dollar-cost averaging strategy and to set up Telegram notifications. If implemented as is, the script will trade one share of the Xtrackers MSCI World Swap ETF 1C weekly. 

A walk-through of this script can be found in this [blog-post](https://medium.com/lemon-markets/using-the-lemon-markets-api-to-diy-your-etf-savings-plan-using-cost-averaging-57525feaa275).

### Environment Variables

You'll notice that the script uses several environment variables. Please define the following in an .env file or within your IDE:

* `API_KEY` - Your lemon.markets API key
* `MIC` - Market Identifier Code of chosen Trading Venue
* `BASE_URL_TRADING` - The base URL of the lemon.markets Trading API
* `BASE_URL_DATA` - The base URL of the lemon.markets Market Data API
* `SPACE_ID` - UUID of your space

### Telegram Bot

In this repository, we're using [send-telegram](https://pypi.org/project/telegram-send/) to send messages using Telegram. Install Telegram on your smartphone and message `/newbot` to @BotFather to get started. BotFather will give you a token, which can be used to interact with your bot. 

send-telegram can be installed in your terminal using pip as follows:
```
pip install telegram-send
```
It can be configured with:
```
telegram-send --configure 
```
You will be prompted to fill in the token you received, at which point you will receive a password. Upon sending this password to your bot using the Telegram app, your script will be configured with your bot. Full installation instructions for send-telegram can be found [here](https://pypi.org/project/telegram-send/#installation).

You can now use send-telegram with the command:
```
telegram_send.send(messages=["Hello!"])
```
